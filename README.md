## Amazon Rekognition Video

You can use Amazon Rekognition Video to detect and recognize faces or detect objects in streaming video. Amazon Rekognition Video uses Amazon Kinesis Video Streams to receive and process a video stream. You create a stream processor with parameters that show what you want the stream processor to detect from the video stream. Rekognition sends label detection results from streaming video events as Amazon SNS and Amazon S3 notifications. Rekognition outputs face search results to a Kinesis data stream.
